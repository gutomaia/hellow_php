Little brief MSN Protocol crash course.

The msn protocol basicaly uses two protocols command groups:

One is the NOTIFICATION protocol, witch it uses to connect to msn and get information about what is the user contact list and how is online.

The other is the SWITCHBOARD protocol, witch it uses on the message conversations. Each chat window opens it's own switchboard.
So we got this tree class hiearchy:

		MSNP
		  |
	-------------------------
	|			|
	Notification		Swichboard
	|			|
	Msnp8			Msnc1
	|
	Msnp9 (not implemented yet)


This basic structure i belive that better maps the problem (any other sugestion are welcome).

The Msnp class is an abstract class that implement the basic connection, command input and output.

The Notification is an abstract class that implement basic functions only avaible on the Notification part, like login, logout and defines behaviors for the listeners.

Msnp8 is an concrete class. It does implemement the protocol version 8.

Msnp9 is just to ilustrate (for now) the there are only minor diferences between protocol versions.

The Switchboard is an abstract class that implement very basic fucntions about the message chat.

Mscn1 is an implemen
